Playwright blocked — React app not rendering in headless browser

Error: Page.wait_for_selector: Timeout 15000ms exceeded.
Call log: waiting for locator("[data-testid=login-email-input], input[type=email], form") to be visible

Cause: Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000/supplier/auth succeeds (commit), but form/inputs never appear.
Debug screenshot _debug_supplier_auth.png: mostly white/blank page.

Possible causes:
- React app JS bundle fails in headless Chromium
- CORS/network restrictions in sandbox
- React needs longer hydration

Fix attempted:
- PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/Library/Caches/ms-playwright
- wait_until="commit" (networkidle times out)
- 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost

Screenshot 01_ports_ok.png was captured successfully (home page).
Screenshots 02-04 require manual capture in browser.
