# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

TEST RESULTS: (1) ✅ CORRECT SPELLINGS: 'сибас' found 3 СИБАС products, 'лосось' found 11 ЛОСОСЬ products. (2) ✅ TYPO TOLERANCE (1 char difference): 'сибац' (с→ц) found 3 СИБАС products, 'сибасс' (extra с) found 3 СИБАС products, 'лососк' (ь→к) found 11 ЛОСОСЬ products, 'ласось' (о→а) found 11 ЛОСОСЬ products. (3) ✅ NO FALSE POSITIVES: 'сибас' correctly does NOT match 'ЛАПША' (noodles) or 'Колбаса' (sausage). (4) ✅ MULTI-WORD SEARCH: 'сибас 300' found 3 products, 2 containing both terms (СИБАС with 300g weight). (5) ✅ PRICE SORTING: Results sorted correctly by lowest price first (906.50 ₽, 931.44 ₽, 948.94 ₽). Typo map correctly handles common misspellings and fuzzy logic requires first 2-3 characters to match to prevent false positives. Feature working perfectly as designed."

    message: "USER REPORTED FEATURES TESTING (2025-12-20): Tested two features user reported as NOT working: (1) ❌ FUZZY/TYPO SEARCH: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Comprehensive testing confirms fuzzy search does not work. Typo searches return 0 results: 'лососк' (0 results), 'ласось' (0 results), while correct spellings work: 'лосось' (14 results), 'сибас' (3 results). Current implementation uses exact substring matching only (lines 249-271 in CustomerCatalog.js). Need to implement Levenshtein distance algorithm or use fuzzy matching library like fuse.js. (2) ⚠️ DRAG AND DROP IN FAVORITES: NOT TESTED - Code implementation exists (lines 108-151 with drag handlers, lines 320-323 with draggable attributes), but per system limitations, drag and drop features cannot be tested. Favorites page accessible with 23 draggable cards present. Recommend manual verification or alternative testing approach."

    message: "FUZZY SEARCH COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED (2025-12-21): ✅ ALL TEST CASES PASSED - Fuzzy search feature is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and working perfectly. Main agent has successfully implemented typo correction map and Levenshtein-like fuzzy matching algorithm. DETAILED TEST RESULTS: (1) ✅ CORRECT SPELLINGS: 'сибас' → 3 СИБАС products found, 'лосось' → 11 ЛОСОСЬ products found. (2) ✅ TYPO TOLERANCE (1 character difference): 'сибац' (с→ц typo) → 3 СИБАС products, 'сибасс' (extra с) → 3 СИБАС products, 'лососк' (ь→к typo) → 11 ЛОСОСЬ products, 'ласось' (о→а typo) → 11 ЛОСОСЬ products. All typos correctly find the intended products. (3) ✅ NO FALSE POSITIVES: 'сибас' search correctly excludes 'ЛАПША' (noodles) and 'Колбаса' (sausage) - no unrelated products appear. (4) ✅ MULTI-WORD SEARCH: 'сибас 300' → 3 products found, 2 containing both 'СИБАС' and '300' in description. (5) ✅ PRICE SORTING: All results sorted correctly by lowest price first (906.50 ₽, 931.44 ₽, 948.94 ₽ for СИБАС; 983.34 ₽, 1509.30 ₽, 1518.00 ₽ for ЛОСОСЬ). Implementation uses typo map (lines 257-262) for common misspellings and fuzzy matching logic (lines 279-314) with strict prefix checking (first 2-3 chars must match) to prevent false positives. Feature working exactly as designed - ready for production use."
